photonboy 1e-7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is "photonboy" -- an experimental game and rendering engine that was made
at the spring 2012 Exile Indie Game Jam in about 48 hours.

It was written from scratch in C++ and features ray-casting into a curious new
world, where space itself is relative, and where objects may appear in multiple
places at the same time, plus of course lots of awesome pixel-sized particles.

The main programming was done by Lasse Jon Fuglsang Pedersen and Tim Garbos,
with Peter Bruun-Rasmussen joining in for audio programming.
